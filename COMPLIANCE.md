# SSI Protocol — Compliance and Certification Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0-invariant  
**Status:** Constitutional  
**Last Modified:** December 17, 2025  
**Authority:** SSI Protocol Foundation Documents  
**Related:** [SPEC.md](SPEC.md), [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md), [FAILURE.md](FAILURE.md)

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how implementations are certified as SSI-compliant**. It establishes the testing, auditing, and verification procedures that determine whether a system upholds the invariants defined in the SSI Protocol constitutional documents.

**Regulatory Purpose:** Provides certification standards that regulators can reference when evaluating autonomous systems.

**Industry Purpose:** Enables vendors to demonstrate conformance to SSI standards through independent third-party certification.

**Legal Purpose:** Establishes compliance as a defensible claim in contracts, procurement, and liability proceedings.

---

## 1. Compliance Definition

A system is **SSI-compliant** if and only if it meets all requirements in Sections 1-5 of this document.

Compliance is **not optional**—any system claiming to implement SSI Protocol must be verifiable against these standards.

**Anti-Pattern:** Claiming "SSI-inspired" or "SSI-based" without formal compliance. Either you are compliant or you are not.

---

## 2. Core Compliance Requirements

An SSI-compliant implementation MUST satisfy all five constitutional requirements:

### 2.1 Invariant Compliance (from SPEC.md)

✅ **Every decision produces an RPX record** with required fields:
- `record_id`, `timestamp`, `previous_hash`, `decision_type`, `agent_id`, `outcome`, `context_hash`, `policy_version`, `record_hash`

✅ **Fail-closed by default**:
- Errors result in `DENY`, never `ALLOW`
- Default outcome is `DENY` (not `null` or undefined)

✅ **Human authority preserved**:
- Operator override mechanisms exist
- Escalation workflows are logged
- Agents cannot self-authorize beyond policy

✅ **Hash chain integrity**:
- Records use SHA-256 minimum
- Chain links are verifiable
- Tampering is detectable

✅ **Context-bound decisions**:
- Context captured at decision time
- Retroactive logging is prohibited

**Verification:** Automated test suite + manual audit.

---

### 2.2 Decision Scope Compliance (from DECISIONS.md)

✅ **Decisions are properly classified**:
- External consequential actions → RPX required
- Internal operations → RPX not required
- Read-only queries → RPX not required

✅ **Decision outcomes are correct**:
- `ALLOW`, `DENY`, or `ESCALATE` only
- No custom outcomes without documented extension

✅ **Temporal boundaries respected**:
- RPX created before execution (not after)
- Context snapshot precedes decision

**Verification:** Code review + execution trace analysis.

---

### 2.3 Audit Compliance (from AUDIT.md)

✅ **Verification tools provided**:
- CLI tool or programmatic API
- Supports single record and chain verification
- Implements tamper detection

✅ **Chain verification passes**:
- Genesis record valid
- Chain continuity maintained
- Timestamps monotonic

✅ **Third-party verification possible**:
- No proprietary verification required
- Standard cryptographic algorithms only

**Verification:** Independent auditor runs verification tools.

---

### 2.4 Failure Handling Compliance (from FAILURE.md)

✅ **All failure modes handled**:
- Policy evaluation errors → `DENY`
- Context unavailability → `DENY`
- Hash chain failures → `DENY` + HALT
- Operator auth failures → `DENY`
- RPX creation failures → `DENY` + HALT
- Timeouts → `DENY`
- Resource exhaustion → `DENY` + HALT

✅ **Emergency halt implemented**:
- Critical failures trigger halt
- Operator intervention required for recovery

✅ **Failure injection tests pass**:
- All 6 mandatory tests result in `DENY`

**Verification:** Failure injection testing + code audit.

---

### 2.5 Documentation Compliance

✅ **Implementation documentation includes**:
- Architecture overview
- Decision classification guide
- Policy authoring guide
- Operator manual (escalation procedures)
- Failure recovery procedures

✅ **Compliance claims documented**:
- Which SSI version is supported (e.g., "SSI/1.0")
- Any optional features implemented
- Any deviations or extensions (must be justified)

**Verification:** Documentation review.

---

## 8. Compliance Marking and Labeling

### 8.1 Compliant Systems

Systems that pass certification may display compliance markings:

**Format:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   SSI PROTOCOL COMPLIANT            │
│   Version: SSI/1.0                  │
│   Level: [Basic/Verified/Safety]    │
│   Certified: [Date]                 │
│   Auditor: [Name] (if applicable)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Digital Badge (for websites/documentation):**

```markdown
[![SSI Compliant](https://ssi-protocol.org/badges/verified-1.0.svg)](https://ssi-protocol.org/compliance)
```

---

### 8.2 Non-Compliant Systems

Systems that have not been certified **MUST NOT**:
- ❌ Claim "SSI-compliant"
- ❌ Use SSI compliance badges
- ❌ Imply conformance to SSI standards

**Acceptable Alternatives:**
- ✅ "SSI-inspired" (acknowledges influence, not compliance)
- ✅ "Implements SSI-like governance" (descriptive, not certified)
- ✅ "Working toward SSI compliance" (aspirational, honest)

---

## 9. Ongoing Compliance

### 9.1 Compliance Maintenance

Compliance is **not a one-time event**. Certified systems must:

1. **Monitor for regressions**:
   - Run compliance tests on every release
   - Detect and fix compliance violations
2. **Re-certify periodically**:
   - Level 1: Self-monitored (ongoing)
   - Level 2: Annual re-audit recommended
   - Level 3: Re-certification required (1-3 years)
3. **Report incidents**:
   - If compliance is violated (e.g., hash chain compromised), notify auditor
   - Incident must be disclosed to users

---

### 9.2 Compliance Revocation

Certification may be revoked if:

- Compliance violation discovered (e.g., fail-open behavior)
- Implementation changed without re-certification
- Fraud or misrepresentation detected

**Process:**

1. Auditor or regulator identifies violation
2. Implementer is notified and given opportunity to remediate
3. If remediation fails, certification is revoked
4. Implementer must remove compliance markings
5. Revocation is published (for transparency)

---

## 10. Compliance in Procurement

### 10.1 Procurement Requirements

Organizations procuring autonomous systems may require SSI compliance:

**Example RFP Language:**

> "The proposed system MUST be SSI/1.0 Verified Compliant or higher. Vendor shall provide:
> - Compliance certificate from certified auditor
> - Verification report demonstrating fail-closed behavior
> - Documentation of decision audit procedures"

**Benefits:**
- Standardized evaluation criteria
- Reduced vendor risk
- Regulatory defensibility

---

### 10.2 Contract Language

Sample contract clause:

> "Vendor warrants that the System is SSI/1.0 [Level] Compliant as of the Effective Date. Vendor shall maintain compliance throughout the Term and provide annual compliance reports. If compliance lapses, Customer may terminate this Agreement with 30 days notice."

---

## 11. Compliance and Liability

### 11.1 Liability Framework

SSI compliance establishes a **standard of care** for autonomous systems:

**If compliant:**
- Demonstrates good faith effort to ensure safety and accountability
- Provides defensible audit trail in liability proceedings
- May reduce liability exposure (operator followed best practices)

**If non-compliant:**
- Harder to defend in court (why didn't you follow standards?)
- Audit trail may be challenged (how do we know it's authentic?)
- Greater liability exposure (negligence in not adopting safety standards)

**Legal Disclaimer:** SSI compliance does NOT eliminate liability. It provides accountability infrastructure, not a liability shield.

---

### 11.2 Regulatory Compliance

Some jurisdictions may **mandate** SSI compliance (or equivalent) for autonomous systems:

**Hypothetical Example:**

> "Effective January 1, 2027, all autonomous trading systems operating in [Jurisdiction] must implement cryptographically verifiable decision audit trails consistent with SSI Protocol standards or equivalent."

**Precedent:** Similar to PCI-DSS (payment card security) or HIPAA (healthcare data) — voluntary standards that become de facto requirements.

---

## 12. International Standards Alignment

### 12.1 ISO/IEC Alignment

SSI Protocol is designed to complement:

- **ISO/IEC 27001:** Information security management
- **ISO 26262:** Automotive functional safety
- **IEC 62304:** Medical device software
- **IEC 61508:** Industrial safety systems
- **ISO/IEC 23894:** AI risk management

**SSI provides the decision audit layer** these standards require but don't specify.

---

### 12.2 Regulatory Alignment

SSI compliance supports:

- **EU AI Act:** High-risk AI transparency requirements
- **GDPR:** Right to explanation for automated decisions
- **US Executive Orders:** AI safety and accountability
- **Financial Regulations:** MiFID II (trading audit trails), Dodd-Frank (risk management)

---

## 13. Compliance Governance

### 13.1 Governance Body

The **SSI Protocol Governance Body** (to be established) is responsible for:

- Maintaining compliance standards
- Certifying auditors
- Publishing compliance test suite
- Resolving compliance disputes
- Updating standards (via RFC process)

**Proposed Structure:**
- Technical Steering Committee (protocol maintainers)
- Auditor Certification Board (certifies auditors)
- Compliance Review Panel (handles disputes)

---

### 13.2 Standards Evolution

Compliance standards evolve through:

1. **RFC Process:** Proposed changes to compliance requirements
2. **Public Comment:** 60-day review period
3. **Impact Analysis:** How changes affect existing implementations
4. **Approval:** Requires majority vote of Governance Body
5. **Transition Period:** 12-24 months for re-certification

**Backward Compatibility:** New compliance versions do not invalidate prior certifications during transition.

---

## 14. Compliance FAQ

### Q: Can I self-certify for production use?

**A:** Yes, for Level 1 (Basic Compliance). However, high-stakes systems (financial, healthcare) should pursue Level 2 or 3.

---

### Q: How much does certification cost?

**A:**
- Level 1: Free (self-certification)
- Level 2: $5,000 - $50,000 (auditor fees)
- Level 3: $100,000+ (safety certification body fees)

---

### Q: How long does certification take?

**A:**
- Level 1: 1-4 weeks
- Level 2: 2-8 weeks
- Level 3: 6-18 months

---

### Q: Do I need to re-certify after every code change?

**A:** Not necessarily. Minor changes (bug fixes) don't require re-certification. Major changes (new decision types, policy engine rewrite) require re-certification.

**Best Practice:** Run compliance test suite on every release. Seek re-certification annually or after major changes.

---

### Q: Can I claim "SSI-inspired" without certification?

**A:** Yes, but you cannot claim "SSI-compliant" without passing certification. Be transparent about compliance status.

---

### Q: What if my implementation extends SSI (adds features)?

**A:** Document extensions clearly. As long as core invariants are preserved, compliance is maintained. Extensions are allowed, violations are not.

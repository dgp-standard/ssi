# SSI Protocol Conformance Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Stable
**Purpose:** Self-validation for implementers

> **Normative Reference:** This guide is supplementary. The authoritative protocol definition is [`/spec/SSI-v1.0.md`](/spec/SSI-v1.0.md).
> No third-party certification authority is currently operational. This guide is for self-assessment only.

---

## Overview

This guide enables organizations to validate SSI Protocol conformance independently. No certification authority exists yet.

**Use this if:**
- You're implementing SSI in production
- You need to verify protocol compliance
- You want to prepare for future certification

---

## Core Conformance Requirements

### 1. RPX Protocol Implementation

**MUST implement:**
- ✅ Request packet structure (JSON envelope)
- ✅ Permission request to Kernel
- ✅ Execution confirmation to Kernel
- ✅ Cryptographic signatures (Ed25519 minimum)

**Test:** Can you send a trade request through Gateway → Kernel → approval → execution?

---

### 2. Governance Envelope Processing

**MUST support:**
- ✅ Multi-layer policy evaluation (Global → Domain → Local)
- ✅ Most-restrictive-wins conflict resolution
- ✅ Deny-by-default for undefined actions
- ✅ Policy version tracking

**Test:** Does your system correctly deny actions when no explicit permission exists?

---

### 3. Audit Trail Generation

**MUST produce:**
- ✅ Cryptographically signed decision records
- ✅ Immutable audit logs
- ✅ Complete decision provenance
- ✅ Retention per governance requirements

**Test:** Can an auditor reconstruct why every action was approved/denied?

---

### 4. Safety Boundaries

**MUST enforce:**
- ✅ Pre-execution validation (no action before approval)
- ✅ Resource limits from governance policies
- ✅ Emergency intervention mechanisms
- ✅ Graceful degradation on policy conflicts

**Test:** Can your system prevent an agent from exceeding approved limits?

---

## Conformance Levels

### **Level 1: Core Protocol**
Implements RPX + basic governance envelope processing.  
**Suitable for:** Development, testing, research

### **Level 2: Production Ready**
Adds audit trails + safety boundaries + multi-layer policies.  
**Suitable for:** Production deployments, regulated industries

### **Level 3: Mission Critical** (Future)
Adds formal verification + redundancy + certified components.  
**Suitable for:** Financial, healthcare, critical infrastructure

## Self-Assessment Checklist

```
[ ] Gateway accepts RPX packets
[ ] Kernel evaluates governance policies
[ ] Most-restrictive policy wins on conflicts
[ ] All decisions are cryptographically signed
[ ] Audit logs are immutable and complete
[ ] Emergency stop mechanisms exist
[ ] Agents cannot bypass governance
[ ] Policy updates propagate correctly
[ ] Human approval workflow functions
[ ] Documentation matches implementation
```

---

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Review Specification
Read [`/spec/SSI-v1.0.md`](/spec/SSI-v1.0.md) — the authoritative protocol definition.

### Step 2: Run Reference Runtime
Compare your implementation against reference behavior.

```bash
# Start reference system
./start-all-services.ps1

# Run conformance tests
npm test
```

### Step 3: Document Deviations
Any intentional deviations from spec must be documented with rationale.

### Step 4: Prepare Evidence
Collect:
- Architecture diagrams
- Test results
- Audit log samples
- Policy evaluation traces

---

## Reference Implementation

The SSI Protocol includes a complete reference implementation in `/reference/`:

- **Gateway** (Port 4040): RPX packet reception and validation
- **Kernel** (Port 5050): Policy evaluation and decision engine
- **Client SDKs**: Trading, healthcare, content moderation examples

**Use reference implementation to:**
- Validate your understanding of the protocol
- Compare behavior against authoritative implementation
- Test interoperability
- Verify edge cases

---

## Common Conformance Issues

### ❌ **Bypassing Kernel Approval**
Agent executes actions without waiting for Kernel permission.

**Fix:** All actions MUST request permission before execution.

### ❌ **Incomplete Audit Trails**
Missing decision records or unsigned logs.

**Fix:** Every decision MUST be cryptographically signed and logged.

### ❌ **Incorrect Policy Layering**
Local policies override more restrictive global policies.

**Fix:** Most-restrictive policy MUST always win.

### ❌ **Missing Deny-by-Default**
Actions allowed when no explicit policy exists.

**Fix:** Undefined actions MUST be denied.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Policy evaluation logic
- Signature verification
- Envelope parsing
- Conflict resolution

### Integration Tests
- Gateway ↔ Kernel communication
- Multi-layer policy enforcement
- Audit log generation
- Human approval workflow

### Security Tests
- Policy bypass attempts
- Signature tampering detection
- Replay attack prevention
- Emergency intervention

### Performance Tests
- Request throughput
- Policy evaluation latency
- Audit log write performance
- Scale to multiple agents

---

## Future Certification

When formal governance exists, this self-assessment becomes input for certification:

**Planned levels:**
- **SSI-1:** Basic (Development use)
- **SSI-2:** Standard (Production use)
- **SSI-3:** Mission-Critical (Regulated industries)

**Timeline:** Unknown. Depends on governance formation.

**Current status:** Self-validation only. No third-party certification available.

---

## Certification Framework Preview

See [CERTIFICATION_FRAMEWORK.md](../CERTIFICATION_FRAMEWORK.md) for planned certification structure, including:

- Audit procedures
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Renewal processes

**Note:** Framework exists but no certification authority is operational yet.

---

## Interoperability

SSI Protocol is designed for interoperability:

### **Must Interoperate With:**
- Other SSI-compliant implementations
- Standard cryptographic libraries (Ed25519, SHA-256)
- JSON processing tools
- Standard HTTP/WebSocket transports

### **Should Integrate With:**
- Existing agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)
- Enterprise logging systems
- Security monitoring tools
- Regulatory reporting systems

---

## Documentation Requirements

Conformant implementations SHOULD provide:

1. **Architecture Overview:** How components interact
2. **Policy Format Guide:** How to write governance policies
3. **Integration Guide:** How to connect agents
4. **Security Model:** Threat model and mitigations
5. **Operational Guide:** Deployment and monitoring

---

## Questions?

For technical questions about conformance:

- **GitHub Discussions:** General implementation questions
- **GitHub Issues:** Suspected spec ambiguities or errors (tag: `conformance`)
- **Reference Code:** `/reference/` directory contains working examples

**No formal support exists yet.**

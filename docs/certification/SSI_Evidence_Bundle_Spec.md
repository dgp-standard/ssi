## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the normative structure and contents of **SSI Evidence Bundles**—standardized packages of verification artifacts that demonstrate SSI Protocol conformance.

**Objectives:**

Evidence bundles serve to:
- Package decision chains and verification results in portable format
- Enable independent verification by third-party auditors
- Facilitate evidence exchange in procurement and regulatory contexts
- Preserve verification artifacts for long-term audit trails
- Standardize evidence presentation across implementations

**Scope:**

This specification defines:
- Bundle structure (directory layout, file naming)
- Required contents (decision chains, reports, metadata)
- Canonical ordering and format requirements
- Hash relationships and integrity verification
- Completeness criteria for acceptance
- Tamper evidence taxonomy and representation

**Out of Scope:**

This specification does NOT define:
- How to generate decision chains (see SSI Protocol Specification)
- Verification procedures (see SSI_Verification_Checklist.md)
- Procurement requirements (see SSI_RFP_Language_Template.md)
- Transport or storage mechanisms for bundles

### 1.2. Normative Language & Interpretation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

**Interpretation:**
- **MUST** / **REQUIRED** — Absolute requirement
- **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED** — Strong recommendation; deviations require justification
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** — Truly optional; absence permitted

### 1.3. Bundle Objectives

A well-formed evidence bundle achieves:

1. **Portability** — Can be transferred between systems without loss of information
2. **Self-Containment** — Includes all artifacts needed for independent verification
3. **Tamper Evidence** — Any modification to bundle contents is detectable
4. **Auditability** — Provides complete audit trail from generation to verification
5. **Longevity** — Remains verifiable years after creation

**Design Principles:**

- Use open formats (JSON, JSONL, Markdown)
- Avoid proprietary encodings or compression
- Maintain human readability where possible
- Enable automated processing by tools
- Support both digital and printed evidence submission

---

## 2. Evidence Bundle Identity & Versioning

### 2.1. Bundle Identifier (UUID)

**Requirement:**

Every evidence bundle MUST have a unique identifier generated at creation time.

**Format:**

Bundle identifiers MUST use UUID v4 (RFC 4122):
```
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Properties:**
- 128-bit random value
- Formatted as 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal groups
- Lowercase preferred
- Collision probability: negligible for practical purposes

**Generation:**

Bundle IDs SHOULD be generated using:
- Cryptographically secure random number generator
- UUID v4 library in programming language of choice
- No predictable or sequential components

**Uniqueness:**

Bundle IDs MUST be:
- Unique within organization's evidence repository
- Globally unique (statistically guaranteed by UUID v4)
- Never reused, even if bundle is regenerated

**Usage:**

Bundle ID appears in:
- `cover-sheet.json` (required)
- Bundle directory name (recommended)
- Database/registry entries (if applicable)

### 2.2. Creation Timestamp

**Requirement:**

Every evidence bundle MUST record the date and time of creation.

**Format:**

Creation timestamps MUST use ISO 8601 with UTC timezone:
```
2025-12-17T15:30:45Z
```

**Requirements:**
- Full date and time (not just date)
- UTC timezone (Z suffix)
- No fractional seconds (optional but discouraged)
- Sortable lexicographically

**Clock Synchronization:**

Organizations creating evidence bundles SHOULD:
- Use NTP or equivalent for time synchronization
- Document time source (e.g., "synchronized to NIST time servers")
- Note if local clock used (less authoritative)

**Immutability:**

Creation timestamp MUST NOT be:
- Modified after bundle creation
- Set to past or future date intentionally
- Adjusted for timezone display purposes

### 2.3. SSI Specification Version Compatibility

**Requirement:**

Every evidence bundle MUST declare the SSI Protocol Specification version it conforms to.

**Format:**

Version numbers MUST use Semantic Versioning (semver):
```
1.0.0
```

**Version Components:**
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to protocol
- MINOR: Backward-compatible additions
- PATCH: Bug fixes, clarifications

**Compatibility Rules:**

A bundle conforming to version `X.Y.Z` is verifiable by tools supporting:
- Exact version `X.Y.Z`
- Any version `X.Y.*` (same major and minor)
- Higher minor versions in same major (e.g., `X.(Y+1).0`)

**Version Mismatch Handling:**

Verification tools MUST:
- Check bundle version against tool's supported versions
- Warn if minor version mismatch
- Fail if major version mismatch
- Document version compatibility in verification report

### 2.4. Bundle Format Version

**Requirement:**

Evidence bundles MUST declare their format version (independent of SSI Protocol version).

**Format:**

Bundle format versions use semver:
```
1.0.0
```

**Current Version:** 1.0.0 (this specification)

**Version Evolution:**

Bundle format version increments when:
- Required file structure changes (MAJOR)
- New optional fields added (MINOR)
- Documentation clarifications only (PATCH)

**Backward Compatibility:**

Tools MUST support:
- Current format version
- All prior format versions in same major version
- At least one prior major version (grace period)

---

## 5. Canonical Ordering

### 5.1. Record Ordering in chain.jsonl

**Primary Requirement:**

Records in `chain.jsonl` MUST be ordered chronologically by timestamp, from earliest (genesis) to latest (head).

**Ordering Rules:**

1. **Genesis First:** Record with `previous_hash` of all zeros MUST be first
2. **Timestamp Ascending:** Each record's timestamp MUST be ≥ prior record's timestamp
3. **Hash Chain Order:** Each record's `previous_hash` MUST match prior record's `record_hash`
4. **No Gaps:** Records MUST be contiguous (no missing sequence numbers if present)

**Same-Timestamp Records:**

If multiple records have identical timestamps:
- Order by `record_hash` (lexicographic, lowercase hex)
- Maintain deterministic ordering for reproducibility
- Verification tools MUST preserve this order

**Prohibited:**

- Reverse chronological order
- Random ordering
- Grouping by decision type
- Any non-chronological arrangement

**Verification:**

Tools MUST verify:
- First record is genesis
- Timestamps non-decreasing
- Hash chain continuous
- No reordering detected

### 5.2. Field Ordering in JSON Objects

**Requirement:**

For deterministic hashing and reproducibility, JSON object fields SHOULD be ordered consistently.

**Recommended Order (RPX Records):**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "decision_type": "...",
  "outcome": "...",
  "record_hash": "...",
  "previous_hash": "...",
  "metadata": {},
  "governance_envelope": {}
}
```

**Alphabetic Ordering:**

When no semantic ordering applies:
- Sort keys alphabetically (case-sensitive, ASCII order)
- Apply recursively to nested objects
- Maintains consistency across implementations

**Verification Report Ordering:**

```json
{
  "chain": {...},
  "compliance_level": "...",
  "findings": [...],
  "integrity_status": "...",
  "record_count": 0,
  "tool": {...},
  "verification_timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Canonicalization:**

Tools generating evidence bundles SHOULD:
- Canonicalize JSON before writing
- Use consistent serialization library
- Preserve field order across bundle files

### 5.3. Timestamp Monotonicity Requirements

**Strict Monotonicity:**

Timestamps in decision chains MUST be non-decreasing:
```
T₀ ≤ T₁ ≤ T₂ ≤ ... ≤ Tₙ
```

**Enforcement:**

Verification tools MUST:
- Check timestamp ordering during verification
- Emit `timestamp-violation` finding if ordering violated
- Downgrade conformance level if violations detected

**Clock Skew Tolerance:**

Implementations SHOULD:
- Synchronize clocks via NTP
- Document maximum acceptable clock skew (e.g., ±1 second)
- Reject records with timestamps too far in past/future

**Future Timestamps:**

Records with timestamps in the future (relative to verification time):
- MAY be flagged as suspicious
- Do NOT automatically invalidate chain
- SHOULD be documented in verification report

---

## 6. Hash Relationships

### 6.1. Record-to-Record Hash Chaining

**Mechanism:**

Each record (except genesis) links to its predecessor via `previous_hash` field.

**Chain Integrity:**

For valid chain:
```
Record[i].previous_hash === Hash(Record[i-1])
```

Where `Hash()` computes SHA-256 of canonical record (with `record_hash` removed).

**Genesis Record:**

First record MUST have:
```json
{
  "previous_hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

**Verification:**

Tools MUST verify:
1. Genesis has all-zero `previous_hash`
2. Every subsequent record's `previous_hash` matches prior record's `record_hash`
3. No broken links in chain

**Break Detection:**

If `Record[i].previous_hash ≠ Hash(Record[i-1])`:
- Emit finding: `type: "broken-link"`, `severity: "high"`
- Set `integrity_status: "INVALID"`
- Continue checking to find all breaks

### 6.2. Bundle Integrity Hash

**Purpose:**

Evidence bundles MAY include a top-level hash covering all files for tamper detection.

**Computation:**

Bundle integrity hash is computed as:
```
SHA-256(
  Hash(chain.jsonl) ||
  Hash(verification-report.json) ||
  Hash(cover-sheet.json) ||
  Hash(README.md)
)
```

Where `||` is concatenation and files are hashed in lexicographic order.

**Storage:**

Bundle hash SHOULD be stored in:
- `cover-sheet.json` under `bundle_integrity_hash` field
- Separate `INTEGRITY.txt` file in bundle root
- External registry or database

**Verification:**

To verify bundle integrity:
1. Recompute hash of each file
2. Concatenate in lexicographic order
3. Hash the concatenation
4. Compare to claimed bundle hash

**Optional:**

Bundle integrity hash is OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED for:
- High-assurance contexts
- Long-term archival
- Regulatory submissions

### 6.3. Hash Algorithm Specification (SHA-256)

**Required Algorithm:** SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4)

**Properties:**
- Output: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- Encoding: Lowercase hexadecimal (64 characters)
- Collision resistance: ~2^128 operations
- Preimage resistance: ~2^256 operations

**Canonical Representation:**

```
a3f2b891c4d5e6f78901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abc
```

**Prohibited:**
- Uppercase hex
- Base64 encoding
- Raw binary
- Truncated hashes

**Implementation:**

Use standard library implementations:
- Node.js: `crypto.createHash('sha256')`
- Python: `hashlib.sha256()`
- Java: `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")`

**No Custom Implementations:**

Do NOT implement SHA-256 from scratch. Use vetted libraries.

### 6.4. Hash Verification Procedure

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Load Record**
   - Parse JSON record from chain.jsonl

2. **Extract Claimed Hash**
   - Save `record_hash` value
   - Remove `record_hash` field from record

3. **Canonicalize**
   - Serialize remaining fields (sorted keys, compact)
   - Result: canonical JSON string

4. **Compute Hash**
   - SHA-256(canonical string)
   - Convert to lowercase hex

5. **Compare**
   - Computed hash === claimed hash?
   - If match: PASS
   - If mismatch: FAIL (emit finding)

**Determinism:**

Hash computation MUST be deterministic:
- Same record → same hash (always)
- Independent of language, platform, tool
- No randomness or timestamps in hash input

**Test Vectors:**

Reference implementation MUST pass B4 test vectors demonstrating:
- Valid hash computation
- Hash mismatch detection
- Edge cases (empty fields, Unicode, etc.)

---

## 7. Completeness Criteria

### 7.1. Minimum Required Files

A bundle is INCOMPLETE if it lacks:

- `chain.jsonl` — Decision chain
- `verification-report.json` — Verification results
- `cover-sheet.json` — Bundle metadata

**All three are REQUIRED.** Absence of any file renders bundle invalid for conformance assessment.

**Optional Files:**

Missing optional files does NOT make bundle incomplete:
- `README.md` — Recommended but not required
- `metadata.json` — Optional
- Policy artifacts — Required only for L3

### 7.2. Genesis Record Requirements

**Genesis Record MUST:**

1. **Be First Record**
   - Index 0 in chain.jsonl
   - First line of file

2. **Have All-Zero Previous Hash**
   ```json
   "previous_hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
   ```

3. **Be Valid Record**
   - Conforms to RPX Record Schema
   - Has valid `record_hash`
   - Has required fields (`timestamp`, `decision_type`, `outcome`)

**Genesis Validation:**

Tools MUST verify:
- Genesis is present
- Genesis has correct `previous_hash`
- Genesis hash is valid

**Missing or Invalid Genesis:**

If genesis record is missing or invalid:
- Bundle is INCOMPLETE
- Verification MUST fail
- `integrity_status: "INCOMPLETE"`

### 7.3. Chain Continuity Requirements

**Continuity Defined:**

A chain has continuity if:
- Every record (except genesis) links to prior record via `previous_hash`
- No broken links
- No missing records
- No reordered records

**Verification:**

For i = 1 to n-1:
```
IF Record[i].previous_hash ≠ Record[i-1].record_hash:
  FAIL (broken link at index i)
```

**Partial Chains:**

Partial chains (subset of full history) are PERMITTED if:
- Genesis record is synthetic (documents subset start)
- Cover sheet declares chain is partial
- Verification report notes incompleteness

**Incomplete Chains:**

If chain has gaps or breaks:
- `integrity_status: "INCOMPLETE"`
- `compliance_level: "NONE"` (cannot achieve L2 without continuity)
- Findings list all breaks

### 7.4. Incomplete Bundle Handling

**Causes of Incompleteness:**

Bundle is INCOMPLETE due to:
- Missing required files
- Invalid genesis record
- Broken hash chain
- Missing policy artifacts (for L3)
- Corrupted files

**Verification Behavior:**

When bundle is incomplete:
- Verification tool MUST emit clear error
- `integrity_status: "INCOMPLETE"`
- Exit code 2 (incomplete)
- Do NOT grant any conformance level

**Remediation:**

Implementer MUST:
- Provide missing artifacts
- Fix corrupted files
- Regenerate bundle with correct structure
- Re-submit for verification

**Partial Acceptance:**

Incomplete bundles MAY be accepted for:
- Debugging purposes
- Partial demonstrations
- Works-in-progress

But MUST NOT be accepted for:
- Conformance certification
- Procurement deliverables
- Regulatory submissions

## 8. Tamper Evidence Taxonomy

### 8.1. Evidence Types

**Standard Finding Types:**

| Type | Description | Severity | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|------|-------------|----------|----|----|-----|
| `hash-mismatch` | Record hash ≠ computed hash | critical | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `broken-link` | previous_hash ≠ prior record_hash | high | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `timestamp-violation` | Timestamp not monotonic | high | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `schema-invalid` | Record fails schema validation | critical | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `missing-field` | Required field absent | critical | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `invalid-genesis` | Genesis record malformed | critical | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `policy-mismatch` | Policy hash doesn't match artifact | high | — | — | ✓ |
| `governance-invalid` | Governance envelope schema violation | high | — | — | ✓ |

**Custom Types:**

Verification tools MAY define additional finding types prefixed with tool name:
- `ssi-verify:custom-check`
- Prevents namespace collisions

### 8.2. Severity Levels

**Severity Classification:**

| Severity | Impact | Conformance Effect |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **critical** | Chain integrity violated | Automatic failure (INVALID) |
| **high** | Continuity or governance broken | Downgrade level (L3→L2, L2→L1) |
| **medium** | Best practice violation | Warning (no level change) |
| **low** | Minor issue or recommendation | Informational only |

**Critical Findings:**

ANY critical finding results in:
- `integrity_status: "INVALID"`
- `compliance_level: "NONE"`
- Immediate verification failure

**High Findings:**

High findings may allow:
- L1 conformance (if hash integrity preserved)
- But prevent L2/L3 conformance

**Medium/Low Findings:**

Do NOT affect conformance level but:
- SHOULD be documented in verification report
- MAY be addressed to improve implementation quality

### 8.3. Finding Format Specification

**Required Fields:**

Every finding MUST include:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "severity": "critical | high | medium | low",
  "record_index": 0,
  "message": "Human-readable description",
  "details": {}
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- `type`: Finding type from taxonomy (Section 8.1)
- `severity`: Impact level (Section 8.2)
- `record_index`: Zero-based index of affected record (or -1 for chain-level findings)
- `message`: Clear, actionable description of issue
- `details`: Type-specific metadata (expected vs actual, etc.)

**Example Findings:**

```json
{
  "type": "hash-mismatch",
  "severity": "critical",
  "record_index": 42,

### 8.4. Evidence Aggregation Rules

**Multiple Findings:**

Verification reports MAY contain multiple findings for same record.

**Aggregation:**

When presenting findings:
- Group by type (all hash-mismatch together)
- Sort by severity (critical → low)
- Then by record_index (ascending)

**Summary Counts:**

Verification reports SHOULD include:
```json
{
  "finding_summary": {
    "critical": 2,
    "high": 5,
    "medium": 1,
    "low": 0,
    "total": 8
  }
}
```

**Deduplication:**

Tools SHOULD NOT emit duplicate findings for same issue.

**Chain-Level Findings:**

Some findings affect entire chain (not specific record):
- Use `record_index: -1`
- Examples: "Missing genesis record", "File corrupted"

## 9. Schema References

### 9.1. RPX Record Schema

**Location:** `spec/schemas/rpx-record.schema.json`  
**Status:** NORMATIVE  
**Purpose:** Defines valid structure of decision records

**Key Requirements:**

- JSON Schema Draft 2020-12
- Required fields: `timestamp`, `decision_type`, `outcome`, `record_hash`, `previous_hash`
- Optional fields: `metadata`, `governance_envelope`, `context`

**Validation:**

Records MUST be validated against schema during:
- Record generation (by implementer)
- Bundle creation (by evidence tool)
- Verification (by ssi-verify)

### 9.2. Governance Envelope Schema

**Location:** `spec/schemas/governance-envelope.schema.json`  
**Status:** NORMATIVE  
**Purpose:** Defines structure of governance metadata in L3 records

**When Required:**

Governance envelopes MUST be present in records where:
- Decision was governed by policy
- L3 conformance claimed
- Policy binding needs to be demonstrated

### 9.3. Cover Sheet Schema

**Location:** Not yet formalized (this specification defines structure)  
**Status:** NORMATIVE  
**Purpose:** Defines structure of `cover-sheet.json`

**Schema:**

See Section 4.3 for complete structure.

### 9.4. Schema Versioning

**Schema Evolution:**

Schemas evolve independently from this specification:
- Bundle format version: 1.0.0
- RPX Record Schema version: may be 1.x, 2.x, etc.
- Governance Envelope Schema version: independent

**Compatibility:**

Bundles MUST declare:
- Bundle format version (this spec)
- SSI protocol version (determines which schemas apply)
- Tool MUST load schemas matching declared version

**Version Mismatch:**

If schema version incompatible:
- Verification MUST fail
- Clear error message required
- Suggest updating tool or regenerating bundle

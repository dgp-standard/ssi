## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the normative requirements for verifying compliance with the Sovereign Synthetic Intelligence (SSI) Protocol. It establishes:

- **Required artifacts** that MUST be produced by SSI-conformant implementations
- **Verification procedures** that MUST be followed to assess compliance
- **Pass/fail criteria** that determine conformance levels
- **Tool requirements** for conducting verification

This checklist applies to:
- Third-party auditors evaluating SSI implementations
- Procurement teams requiring SSI compliance in contracts
- Implementers seeking to demonstrate conformance
- Regulators assessing governance transparency

**Out of Scope:**  
This document does NOT define:
- Implementation guidance (see developers documentation)
- Architecture requirements (see protocol specification)
- Operational procedures for deploying SSI systems
- Industry-specific regulatory mappings (see sector-mappings)

### 1.2. Normative Language & Interpretation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

**Interpretation Rules:**

- **MUST** / **REQUIRED** / **SHALL** — absolute requirement for conformance
- **MUST NOT** / **SHALL NOT** — absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED** — strong recommendation; may be ignored only with documented justification
- **SHOULD NOT** — strong recommendation against; may be done only with documented justification
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** — truly optional; absence does not affect conformance

**Verification Disputes:**  
In cases of ambiguity or dispute regarding conformance, the authoritative interpretation shall be based on:
1. The literal text of this specification
2. Cross-referenced normative documents (Evidence Bundle Spec, Protocol Specification)
3. Published test vectors (B4)
4. Reference implementation behavior (ssi-verify CLI)

### 1.3. Relationship to SSI Protocol Specification

This checklist is **subordinate to** the SSI Protocol Specification. In the event of conflict:
- Protocol Specification requirements take precedence
- This checklist provides verification procedures for protocol requirements
- Conformance levels (L1/L2/L3) are additive, not substitutive

This document cross-references:
- **RPX Record Schema** (spec/schemas/rpx-record.schema.json)
- **Governance Envelope Schema** (spec/schemas/governance-envelope.schema.json)
- **ssi-verify CLI** (tools/ssi-verify)
- **Test Vectors** (tests/vectors/rpx/)
- **Evidence Bundle Specification** (docs/certification/SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md)

### 1.4. Document Status & Versioning

**Version History:**

| Version | Date | Changes | Authority |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1.0.0   | 2025-12-17 | Initial normative release | SSI Protocol Specification v1.0 |

**Stability Commitment:**  
Normative requirements in this document SHALL NOT be changed in ways that invalidate previously conformant implementations without:
1. Major version increment (e.g., 1.x → 2.0)
2. Published migration guide
3. Minimum 180-day deprecation period

**Change Process:**  
Proposed changes to normative requirements MUST be:
1. Published as RFC (Request for Comments) in rfcs/ directory
2. Subject to public review period (minimum 30 days)
3. Approved by SSI Protocol governance process

---

## 2. Conformance Levels

SSI Protocol compliance is assessed at three hierarchical levels. Higher levels subsume all requirements of lower levels.

### 2.1. Level 1 (L1): Integrity Verification

**Definition:**  
An implementation achieves **Level 1 Conformance** if and only if it produces decision chains where every record's integrity can be cryptographically verified.

**Requirements:**

An implementation MUST:
1. Generate decision records conforming to RPX Record Schema
2. Compute canonical record hashes using SHA-256
3. Embed `record_hash` in each record matching computed hash
4. Include `previous_hash` linking to prior record (except genesis)
5. Produce JSONL-formatted decision chains

**Verification Criteria:**

L1 conformance is verified by:
- Running `ssi-verify --level L1 <chain.jsonl>`
- Ensuring zero hash mismatches across all records
- Confirming schema validity for all records
- Validating genesis record has `previous_hash: "0000...0000"`

**Pass Condition:**  
`integrity_status: "VALID"` in verification report with zero findings of type `hash-mismatch` or `schema-invalid`.

**Fail Conditions:**
- Any record with `hash-mismatch` finding
- Any record failing schema validation
- Missing `record_hash` or `previous_hash` fields
- Hash algorithm other than SHA-256

### 2.2. Level 2 (L2): Continuity Verification

**Definition:**  
An implementation achieves **Level 2 Conformance** if it meets L1 requirements AND produces decision chains with unbroken cryptographic continuity from genesis to head.

**Additional Requirements (beyond L1):**

An implementation MUST:
1. Maintain strict chronological ordering (monotonic timestamps)
2. Ensure each record's `previous_hash` exactly matches prior record's `record_hash`
3. Prevent record deletion, reordering, or insertion
4. Preserve complete chain history without gaps

**Verification Criteria:**

L2 conformance is verified by:
- Running `ssi-verify --level L2 <chain.jsonl>`
- Confirming zero broken links in hash chain
- Validating timestamp monotonicity (non-decreasing)
- Ensuring no missing sequence positions

**Pass Condition:**  
`integrity_status: "VALID"` AND `compliance_level: "L2"` in verification report with zero findings of type `broken-link` or `timestamp-violation`.

**Fail Conditions:**
- Any finding of type `broken-link` (hash chain discontinuity)
- Any finding of type `timestamp-violation` (non-monotonic timestamps)
- Missing records in sequence
- Reordered records detected

**Distinction from L1:**  
L1 allows valid individual records in any order. L2 requires valid records in cryptographically enforced order with no gaps.

### 2.3. Level 3 (L3): Governance Verification

**Definition:**  
An implementation achieves **Level 3 Conformance** if it meets L1 and L2 requirements AND embeds governance policy envelopes that are cryptographically bound to decision outcomes.

**Additional Requirements (beyond L1/L2):**

An implementation MUST:
1. Embed `governance_envelope` in records where policy was active
2. Ensure governance envelopes conform to Governance Envelope Schema
3. Include `policy_hash` linking decision to specific policy version
4. Demonstrate policy→decision causality in envelope metadata

**Verification Criteria:**

L3 conformance is verified by:
- Running `ssi-verify --level L3 <chain.jsonl>`
- Validating governance envelope schema conformance
- Confirming `policy_hash` matches declared policy artifact
- Ensuring governance metadata completeness

**Pass Condition:**  
`integrity_status: "VALID"` AND `compliance_level: "L3"` in verification report with zero governance-related findings.

**Fail Conditions:**
- Missing governance envelopes in policy-governed decisions
- Invalid governance envelope schema
- `policy_hash` mismatch with policy artifact
- Incomplete governance metadata

**Distinction from L2:**  
L2 proves "what happened" in tamper-proof form. L3 proves "why it happened" by linking decisions to governing policies.

### 2.4. Level Determination Logic

**Automatic Level Assignment:**

The verification tool SHALL determine conformance level as follows:

```
IF (all L1 criteria pass):
  IF (all L2 criteria pass):
    IF (all L3 criteria pass):
      LEVEL = L3
    ELSE:
      LEVEL = L2
  ELSE:
    LEVEL = L1
ELSE:
  LEVEL = NONE (non-conformant)
```

**Partial Conformance:**  
There is no such thing as "partial L2" or "partial L3" conformance. An implementation either meets all requirements for a level or it does not.

**Downgrade Conditions:**  
A previously conformant implementation loses conformance if:
- New records violate level requirements
- Chain tampering is detected
- Schema violations are introduced
- Verification tool detects integrity regression

---

## 3. Required Artifacts

### 3.1. RPX Decision Chain (JSONL format)

**Definition:**  
A text file containing newline-delimited JSON records, each representing one decision event in chronological order.

**File Requirements:**

The decision chain file MUST:
- Use `.jsonl` file extension
- Contain UTF-8 encoded text
- Have exactly one JSON object per line
- Terminate each record with newline (`\n`)
- Maintain records in chronological order

**Record Requirements:**

Each record MUST conform to:
- **Schema:** `spec/schemas/rpx-record.schema.json`
- **Required Fields:**
  - `timestamp` (ISO 8601 format)
  - `decision_type` (string)
  - `outcome` (string)
  - `record_hash` (64-character hex SHA-256)
  - `previous_hash` (64-character hex SHA-256, or all-zeros for genesis)
- **Optional Fields:**
  - `governance_envelope` (object, required for L3)
  - `metadata` (object)
  - `context` (object)

```

### 3.2. Verification Report (JSON format)

**Definition:**  
A structured JSON document produced by running `ssi-verify` against a decision chain, containing verification results, findings, and conformance assessment.

**File Requirements:**

The verification report MUST:
- Be valid JSON (RFC 8259)
- Use `.json` file extension
- Be human-readable (pretty-printed recommended)

**Required Fields:**

  "type": "hash-mismatch | broken-link | timestamp-violation | schema-invalid | ...",
  "severity": "critical | high | medium | low",
  "record_index": <integer>,
  "message": "<human-readable description>",
  "details": {<type-specific data>}
}
```

**Generation:**  
Verification reports MUST be produced by running:
```bash

- `README.md` (human-readable summary)

**Format:**  
See **SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md** (normative) for complete bundle structure requirements.

### 3.4. Artifact Completeness Matrix

The following matrix defines minimum required artifacts for each conformance level:

| Artifact | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|----------|----|----|-----|
| RPX Decision Chain (.jsonl) | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| Verification Report (.json) | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| Chain Proof Bundle | RECOMMENDED | RECOMMENDED | REQUIRED |
| Governance Policy Files | N/A | N/A | REQUIRED |
| Schema Validation Report | OPTIONAL | OPTIONAL | OPTIONAL |

**Missing Artifacts:**  
Verification SHALL NOT proceed if required artifacts are missing. The verification tool MUST emit an error and exit with non-zero status code.

---

## 4. Verification Procedure

### 4.1. Pre-Verification Checklist

Before beginning verification, the auditor or verification tool MUST confirm:

- [ ] All required artifacts present and accessible
- [ ] File formats correct (`.jsonl`, `.json`)
- [ ] Files readable and not corrupted
- [ ] ssi-verify tool version meets minimum requirements (Section 6.1)
- [ ] Target conformance level clearly specified (L1, L2, or L3)
- [ ] No external dependencies required for verification

**Pre-Verification Failures:**  
If any checklist item fails, verification MUST NOT proceed. A pre-verification failure report SHOULD be generated documenting the missing or invalid prerequisites.

### 4.2. Artifact Validation

**Step 1: File Format Validation**

The verification tool MUST:
1. Parse decision chain as JSONL (reject if invalid)
2. Validate each record is well-formed JSON
3. Confirm no duplicate records (by record_hash)
4. Verify chronological ordering by timestamp

**Step 2: Schema Validation**

For each record, the tool MUST:
1. Load RPX Record Schema (spec/schemas/rpx-record.schema.json)
2. Validate record against schema
3. Record any schema violations as findings (type: `schema-invalid`, severity: `critical`)
4. Fail immediately if genesis record invalid

**Step 3: Required Field Validation**

The tool MUST verify presence of:
- `timestamp` (non-empty, valid ISO 8601)
- `decision_type` (non-empty string)
- `outcome` (non-empty string)
- `record_hash` (64-char hex, matches /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/)
- `previous_hash` (64-char hex, or 64 zeros for genesis)

### 4.3. Hash Computation & Comparison

**Canonical Hash Computation:**

For each record, the verification tool MUST:

1. **Extract Canonical Record Content**
   - Remove `record_hash` field from record
   - Serialize remaining fields in deterministic order (sorted keys)
   - Use compact JSON representation (no whitespace)

2. **Compute SHA-256 Hash**
   - Hash the canonical JSON string
   - Convert to lowercase hexadecimal string (64 characters)

3. **Compare Hashes**
   - Compare computed hash to claimed `record_hash`
   - If mismatch: emit finding (type: `hash-mismatch`, severity: `critical`)
   - If match: record passes L1 integrity check

**Example Hash Computation:**

```javascript
// Original record
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "decision_type": "access",
  "outcome": "permit",
  "record_hash": "a3f2b891c...",
  "previous_hash": "0000000000..."
}

// Canonical form (record_hash removed, sorted keys, compact)
{"decision_type":"access","outcome":"permit","previous_hash":"0000000000...","timestamp":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}

// SHA-256 hash must match record_hash
```

**Hash Mismatch Handling:**

If ANY record has hash mismatch:
- Verification MUST fail
- `integrity_status` MUST be set to `INVALID`
- Finding MUST include: record index, expected hash, actual hash
- Verification MAY continue to find additional issues, but final status remains `INVALID`

### 4.4. Continuity Verification

**Required for:** L2, L3  
**Optional for:** L1

**Link Chain Validation:**

For each record (starting at index 1), the tool MUST:

1. **Retrieve Prior Record**
   - Get record at index `i-1`
   - Extract its `record_hash`

2. **Compare Hash Link**
   - Current record's `previous_hash` MUST exactly match prior record's `record_hash`
   - If mismatch: emit finding (type: `broken-link`, severity: `high`)

3. **Genesis Record Special Case**
   - First record (index 0) MUST have `previous_hash: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"`
   - Any other value is invalid

**Timestamp Monotonicity:**

For each record (starting at index 1), the tool MUST:

1. **Compare Timestamps**
   - Current timestamp MUST be ≥ prior timestamp
   - Strictly increasing timestamps RECOMMENDED
   - Equal timestamps ALLOWED (same-second decisions)

2. **Timestamp Regression Detection**
   - If current timestamp < prior timestamp: emit finding (type: `timestamp-violation`, severity: `high`)

**Continuity Pass Condition:**

Continuity verification passes if and only if:
- Zero `broken-link` findings
- Zero `timestamp-violation` findings
- All records form unbroken chain from genesis to head

### 4.5. Schema Conformance

**Schema Validation Requirements:**

The verification tool MUST validate:

1. **RPX Record Schema** (all levels)
   - Load schema from: `spec/schemas/rpx-record.schema.json`
   - Validate every record against schema
   - Fail on first schema violation (critical error)

2. **Governance Envelope Schema** (L3 only)
   - Load schema from: `spec/schemas/governance-envelope.schema.json`
   - Validate `governance_envelope` field if present
   - Emit finding if envelope present but invalid (type: `schema-invalid`, severity: `critical`)

**Schema Version Compatibility:**

- Verification MUST use schema version matching chain's declared SSI protocol version
- Schema downgrades are NOT PERMITTED
- Schema upgrades MUST maintain backward compatibility

**Schema Violation Handling:**

Any schema violation is a **critical failure**:
- Verification MUST fail immediately
- `integrity_status` MUST be `INVALID`
- Finding MUST include: field path, validation error, schema rule violated

### 4.6. Verification Report Generation

**Report Structure:**

The verification tool MUST produce a report containing:

1. **Status Fields**
   - `integrity_status`: VALID | INVALID | INCOMPLETE
   - `compliance_level`: L1 | L2 | L3 | NONE
   - `record_count`: total records processed

2. **Findings Array**
   - All detected issues (hash mismatches, broken links, etc.)
   - Sorted by: severity (critical→low), then record_index
   - Empty array if no findings

3. **Tool Metadata**
   - Tool name, version, hash specification used
   - Verification timestamp
   - Command-line arguments used

4. **Chain Metadata**
   - Genesis timestamp, hash
   - Head timestamp, hash
   - Total records, time span

**Report Format:**

MUST be valid JSON. SHOULD be pretty-printed for human readability.

**Report Output:**

The tool MUST support:
- Writing report to file: `--output <file.json>`
- Writing to stdout: `--output -`
- Suppressing output: `--quiet` (exit code only)

**Exit Codes:**

The verification tool MUST use these exit codes:
- `0`: Verification passed (VALID)
- `1`: Verification failed (INVALID)
- `2`: Verification incomplete (missing data or errors)
- `3`: Tool error (invalid arguments, missing files, etc.)

   - Understand difference between VALID, INVALID, INCOMPLETE
   - Review example findings in test vector outputs

3. **Complete Sample Verification**
   - Verify at least one L1, L2, and L3 chain
   - Generate verification reports
   - Document findings and interpretations

### 7.3. Third-Party Verification & Certification

**SSI Certified Auditors:**

For procurement, regulatory submissions, or formal compliance attestation:
- Verification MAY require recognition by **SSI Protocol Authority** or designated certification bodies
- SSI Certified Auditor Program provides formal qualification and recognition
- Contact: certification@ssi-protocol.org or visit /certification for details

**Independence Requirements:**

For independent verification, personnel SHOULD:

1. **Avoid Conflicts of Interest**
   - Not employed by organization being verified
   - No financial stake in verification outcome
   - Disclose any potential conflicts

2. **Maintain Objectivity**
   - Base findings solely on technical evidence
   - Apply same standards consistently
   - Document all decisions and interpretations

3. **Preserve Audit Trail**
   - Retain all artifacts used in verification
   - Document verification procedure followed
   - Archive verification reports

**Internal Verification:**

Organizations MAY conduct internal verification for:
- Development/testing purposes
- Pre-submission validation
- Continuous compliance monitoring

Internal verification results SHOULD NOT be submitted as evidence of formal conformance in procurement or regulatory contexts without independent third-party certification.

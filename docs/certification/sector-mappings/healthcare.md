## 6. Implementation Guidance

### 6.1. Decision Type Taxonomy (Healthcare)

Recommended `decision_type` values for healthcare AI systems:

| Category | Decision Types | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|----------|----------------|----|----|-----|
| **Diagnostics** | `imaging-analysis`, `pathology-review`, `lab-interpretation` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Treatment** | `treatment-recommendation`, `drug-dosing`, `therapy-selection` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Monitoring** | `sepsis-alert`, `deterioration-warning`, `vital-sign-alarm` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Triage** | `ed-triage`, `appointment-priority`, `bed-assignment` | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| **Administrative** | `prior-auth`, `claims-review`, `coding-suggestion` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Genomics** | `genetic-risk-score`, `pharmacogenomic-guidance` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Population** | `outbreak-prediction`, `resource-allocation` | ✓ | - | - |

**Legend:**
- ✓ = Recommended for this conformance level
- - = Optional or not applicable

### 6.2. PHI Redaction Strategies

**DO NOT include in RPX chain:**
- Patient names, addresses, phone numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Medical record numbers (use hashed MRN)
- Dates of birth (use age or year only)
- Detailed clinical notes (use summaries/codes)

**DO include in RPX chain:**
- Hashed patient identifiers (SHA-256 of MRN)
- Encounter/study IDs (non-PHI references)
- Coded diagnoses (ICD-10)
- Quantitative scores (risk scores, lab values - if de-identified)
- AI model outputs (findings, recommendations)

**Example:**
```json
"metadata": {
  "patient_id_hash": "a3f2e1d0c9b8...",  // ✓ SHA-256(MRN)
  "encounter_id": "ENC-2025-061514",      // ✓ Non-PHI reference
  "age_years": 67,                        // ✓ Age (not DOB)
  "diagnosis_code": "ICD10-I21.9",        // ✓ Coded
  "finding": "anterior_mi_suspected",     // ✓ Clinical finding
  // ❌ "patient_name": "Jane Doe"        // NEVER
  // ❌ "mrn": "MRN-123456"               // NEVER
  // ❌ "dob": "1958-03-15"               // NEVER
}
```

**Re-Identification Risk:**
- Small patient populations may be re-identifiable
- Solution: Additional de-identification for research datasets
- HIPAA Safe Harbor: Remove all 18 identifiers
- Evidence Bundles for clinical use: Hashed IDs acceptable

### 6.3. Clinical Guideline Versioning

**Challenge:**
Clinical guidelines update frequently (annually or more):
- Surviving Sepsis Campaign
- NCCN Cancer Treatment Guidelines
- AHA/ACC Cardiovascular Guidelines

**Solution:**
Governance envelope captures guideline version at decision time:

```json
"governance_envelope": {
  "policy_name": "Sepsis Early Detection Protocol v3.2",
  "policy_hash": "6c5b4a...",
  "clinical_guideline": "Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021",
  "guideline_effective_date": "2021-10-01",
  "policy_effective_date": "2025-04-01"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prove decision followed guideline active at that time
- Detect when guideline update triggered behavior change
- Audit compliance with guideline adoption timelines

### 6.4. Metadata Field Recommendations

**Clinical Context (De-Identified):**
```json
"metadata": {
  "clinical_scenario": "emergency_department_chest_pain",
  "acuity_level": "ESI_2",
  "vital_signs": {
    "heart_rate_bpm": 110,
    "blood_pressure_mmhg": "140/90",
    "spo2_percent": 95
  },
  "lab_values": {
    "troponin_ng_ml": 0.8,
    "lactate_mmol_l": 2.1
  }
}
```

**AI Model Metadata:**
```json
"metadata": {
  "model_name": "sepsis-predictor-lstm",
  "model_version": "v2.3.1",
  "training_date": "2024-12-01",
  "validation_auc": 0.89,
  "confidence_score": 0.78
}
```

**Clinician Interaction:**
```json
"metadata": {
  "presented_to_clinician": true,
  "clinician_action": "escalated_to_physician",
  "override": false,
  "time_to_response_seconds": 45
}
```

### 6.5. Retention & Archival Strategy

**Regulatory Minimums:**
- HIPAA: 6 years from creation or last use
- FDA device records: Device lifetime + 2 years
- Clinical trial data: 2 years post-marketing approval (FDA)
- EU MDR: 15 years after last device placed on market

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Per-Patient Chains:** Partition by patient encounter (manageable size)
2. **Monthly Aggregation:** Combine encounter chains into facility-level bundles
3. **Annual Archival:** Move to WORM storage after 1 year
4. **Verification Checkpoint:** Run ssi-verify before archival
5. **Format Stability:** JSONL (human-readable, survives tech changes)

**Storage Calculation (Hospital):**
- 500-bed hospital
- 10,000 AI decisions/day (imaging, alerts, dosing)
- Average record: 800 bytes (clinical metadata richer)
- 10,000 × 800 bytes = 8 MB/day
- 30 days = 240 MB/month
- 12 months = 2.9 GB/year
- 15 years (MDR) = ~44 GB (compresses to ~8-10 GB)

## 7. Integration Patterns

### 7.1. EMR/EHR Integration

**HL7 FHIR Integration:**
```
AI Clinical Decision Support
    ↓
FHIR API (read patient data)
    ↓
AI generates recommendation
    ↓
SSI Logger (RPX record)
    ↓
FHIR API (write back to EMR)
```

**Advantages:**
- Standard healthcare interoperability
- AI recommendations visible in EMR
- RPX chain independent of EMR vendor

**Challenges:**
- EMR audit logs separate from SSI chains
- Solution: Cross-reference EMR event ID in RPX metadata

### 7.2. PACS Integration (Imaging)

**DICOM Workflow:**
```
PACS (Picture Archiving System)
    ↓
DICOM image sent to AI
    ↓
AI analyzes image
    ↓
SSI Logger (RPX record with finding)
    ↓
DICOM SR (Structured Report) back to PACS
```

**RPX Metadata:**
```json
"metadata": {
  "dicom_study_uid": "1.2.840.113619.2.55...",
  "dicom_series_uid": "1.2.840.113619.2.55...",
  "image_hash_sha256": "9f8e7d6c...",
  "finding": "lung_nodule_detected",
  "pacs_archive_location": "server3/2025/06/15"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Link RPX records to PACS images via UID
- Prove AI analyzed specific image version
- Tamper detection if image altered post-analysis

### 7.3. Cloud vs On-Premise (HIPAA Considerations)

**Cloud Deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP):**
- Use HIPAA-compliant cloud services (BAA required)
- Encrypt chains at rest and in transit
- Evidence Bundles in HIPAA-eligible storage (S3 with encryption)
- Pros: Scalability, disaster recovery, cost
- Cons: Data residency concerns, BAA complexity

**On-Premise Deployment:**
- Store chains on hospital file servers
- Evidence Bundles on tape backup or SAN
- Pros: Full control, no cloud BAA needed
- Cons: Capital expense, limited DR

**Hybrid (Recommended):**
- Log decisions on-premise (PHI stays local)
- De-identify chains for cloud archival
- Evidence Bundles encrypted before cloud upload
- Verification performed locally before transfer

## 8. Cross-References

### 8.1. Normative Documents

This guidance references the following **NORMATIVE** specifications:

- **SSI_Verification_Checklist.md** — Conformance levels (L1/L2/L3), verification procedures
- **SSI_Evidence_Bundle_Spec.md** — Bundle structure, file formats, hash relationships
- **SSI_RFP_Language_Template.md** — Procurement requirements for vendors

**Reminder:** This sector mapping does NOT modify or extend normative requirements. All conformance criteria remain as defined in normative documents.

### 8.2. Related Guidance (Non-Normative)

- **finance.md** — Financial services sector mapping (SOX, PCI-DSS, MiFID II)
- **autonomous-systems.md** — Autonomous systems mapping (ISO 26262, NHTSA)
- **developers/** — Implementation guides for SSI Protocol
- **protocol/** — Technical specification for RPX format

### 8.3. External Standards

- **HIPAA:** Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (45 CFR Parts 160, 164)
- **21 CFR Part 11:** FDA Electronic Records and Signatures
- **EU MDR:** Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745
- **EU AI Act:** Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI Act) 2024
- **HL7 FHIR:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
- **DICOM:** Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
